    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <h3>Founders</h3>
   <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      at least a billion people, and probably more.
